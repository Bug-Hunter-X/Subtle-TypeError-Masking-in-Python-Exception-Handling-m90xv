This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python exception handling where a TypeError is masked by other exception handlers. The bug.py file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.py provides a corrected version. The primary issue lies in the order of exception handling.  The TypeError should be handled first to ensure it's not masked by a more general exception like ZeroDivisionError or KeyError.
